# Full-Stack Web Application - MERN Stack

This project is a dynamic, responsive web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It demonstrates the seamless integration of a robust backend with an interactive and modern frontend.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic User Interface**: Designed a responsive and user-friendly interface with React.js, ensuring compatibility across various devices.
- **RESTful API**: Built a scalable RESTful API with Express.js and Node.js to handle data interactions efficiently.
- **Database Integration**: Leveraged MongoDB for efficient data storage, retrieval, and seamless implementation of CRUD operations.
- **User Authentication**: Integrated secure authentication mechanisms to safeguard user data and restricted features.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Enabled real-time data updates to enhance interactivity and user engagement.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a clean and modern look across all pages.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Axios

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install backend dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm install
     ```
   - Install frontend dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm install
     ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder and add the following:
     ```
     MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB Connection String>
     PORT=5000
     JWT_SECRET=<Your JWT Secret Key>
     ```
   - Ensure you have a MongoDB database set up and update the `MONGO_URI` accordingly.

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   - Run the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd server
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Run the frontend server:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm start
     ```

5. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
